# AdvoScale Homework

This repository contains a basic laravel application to explore universities in Germany. Your task is to implement a few features/views in this application. The tasks are designed for you to present basic skills in Laravel and Vue.

## Setup

Before you can start, you need to setup the project.

1. Create a new GitHub repository using this repository as a template. You can make your repository private, if you want to. But if you do, please add me as a collaborator. My GitHub username is `IdrisN`.
2. Clone your new repository to your local machine and change into the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    composer install && npm install
    ```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and generate a new application key.
5. Create a file called `database.sqlite` in the `database` directory.
6. Migrate the database and run the database seeders.
7. Done ðŸŽ‰ Now you should be ready to go!

## Tasks

The project contains a fresh laravel application created using the laravel installer. Laravel Breeze with Vue.js and Inertia.js was also added. A `University` and a `Course` model already exist. The database was seeded with a few universities and courses.

Implement the tasks below. You are free to use any package you want but i don't think you will need any. You can also change the existing code if you want to. I would recommend to use Tailwind CSS for styling. The tasks are formulated very broadly. You are free to design the views as you want. Please try to stay close to laravel/PHP and Vue.js best practices and conventions in your code style.

Please commit your changes to your repository as you go. I would like to see your progress. You don't have to commit after every change. But please commit at least after every task.

### Task 1: Implement a list of universities

The first task is to show a list of all universities. The list should contain the name of the university, the link to their website and the number of courses. The list should be sorted by the number of courses in descending order. The list should be paginated with 10 items per page.

You are free to design the list as you want. You can use the `university.index` view to display the list.

### Task 2: Search & Fiter

The second task is to design and implement filters and a search for the university list. The search should allow the user to search for a university by name. The user should be able to filter by course. I.e. the list should only contain universities that offer the selected course. The search field and filter can be placed above the list.

### Task 3: Implement a detail view for universities

The third task is to implement a detail view for universities. Clicking on a university in the list should redirect to a detail view. The view should contain the name of the university, the link to their website and a list of all courses. The list should contain the name of the course and the course category. The list should be sorted by name.

### Task 4: Implement an application form

Finally, we want to simulate the ability to apply for a university. Add a button and two input fields to the detail view of a university. A user should be able to enter their name and email address and apply for the university. In order to simulate an application, you need to do the following:

-   Create an application model with the following attributes: `name`, `email`, `university_id`
-   Create a relationship between the application and the university model
-   Create a route to store a new application

When a user applies for a university, a new application should be created. Validate the input fields. The name and email address are required. Applying should not be possibel if an application with the given email already exists. If the validation fails, show the user an error message. If the validation succeeds, create a new application and redirect the user back to the detail view of the university.

### Rating Criteria

As mentioned, the tasks are formulated very broadly. You are free to design the views as you want. It is important that the tasks are implemented correctly. But it is also important that the code is clean and adheres to best practices and conventions.
Your design does not have to win a design award. But it should be modern and easy to use. A responsive design is not required, but would be nice.

## Submission

When you are done, please send me a link to your repository. Please make sure, that I have access to your repository. My GitHub username is `IdrisN`.
